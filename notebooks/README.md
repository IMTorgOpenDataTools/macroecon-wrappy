# Investigate

* (michael howell) us bank reserves(TOTRESNS), MOVE index, china?
* (russell napier) does financial repression (monetary and asset inflation) lead to higher p/e ratios?
* (richard werner) economic empirical historical research
* in historical examples of asset inflation bubble peaks, how to predict when the music (musical chairs) stops?  there will be quiet selling by insiders of the weakest asset, such as commercial real estate, currently.  Are there any indicators of this: whispers in media (internet archive) or reddit (reddit api), changes in bank loans / reducing exposure (maybe among most sophisticated entities), etc.
