# MacroEcon-WrapPy

Wrapper for macroeconomics timeseries from data across multiple domains and sources (FRED, BEA, BLS, IPUMS, etc.).  This module is used independently of the any API-wrapper.  However, some wrappers are suggested and used in the examples.  An API-wrapper connector is available for improved integration with this module's primary classes.  Where API-wrapper functionality falls short, this module makes direct connections to the site.
